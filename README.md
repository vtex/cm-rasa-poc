# Conversational Commerce RASA POC

This is showing based off of a open source [boilerplate chatbot project](https://github.com/lappis-unb/rasa-ptbr-boilerplate/issues) developed at UnB's Lappis lab.

Read the [boilerplate's README](docs/README.md) for more information on how to run this project locally now.

## Scope

- ~~Hook up the RASA Bot engine to run with both Telegram and Twilio WhatsApp numbers~~
- Set up the Analytics and Logging component of the project so we can quickly iterate with data.
- Train an initial model with a ShoppingList intent and see the entities that are formed in Portuguese.

##  How to run and Demo video

TODO

## Notes

- Could not import name 'json' from 'engineioâ€™ when running *make train*.
	- Solution was to upgrade RASA to 0.39
- Upgraded RASA from the boilerplate project to 2.5.x
- Upgraded RASA X to 0.39.x

### Future TODO
- Move the bot hub from endpoitn from running on this POC to a javacript webhook so we can connect to vtex io / storefront
- Change RabbitMQ to Redis Stream
